# Official Rules for the Valour Platform's Community Economy and Trading Roleplay Systems

By creating a Valour Economy and Trading account (referred to as an 'eco account'), either globally or for a specific community, you are consenting to comply with and be bound by the following rules and regulations.

## Notice of Lack of Material Value

Valour economic and trading systems and associated APIs are designed to give communities and users immersive experiences. They are not intended to replace or function as real currency or a source of value. The only official use of community currencies is the use of Valour Credits (currency id 3) to obtain subscription perks. Valour Credits are not, and do not currently have any plans to become, a cryptocurrency or blockchain-based system. The term 'currency' is used for roleplay and aesthetic purposes and do not indicate a real store of material value.

## Warranty and Liability

Valour disclaims any responsibility for any loss of virtual economic currency or items. In the event of hardware or software failure attributable to Valour, we may, but do not guarantee, to offer actions to help mitigate any user losses. As stated in the previous section, Valour currencies are deemed to be devoid of real-world value.

## User Responsibilities

Community-based currencies (all currencies excluding Valour Credits with id 3) are regulated solely by planet administrators and not Valour staff. Valour holds no responsibility for these currencies, and users must be aware that communities can issue additional currency or mandate transactions with their currencies at their discretion. Valour does not offer assurances on the fairness or validity of transactions.

## Community Rules

Valour is not accountable for economic actions within communities (planets); however, violation of the following rules can lead to community removal:

- Exploiting the economic roleplay system to scam or extort Valour users
- Engaging currencies in activities that infringe on local or international laws, including transactions involving any prohibited material
- Misusing the Economic APIs to malfunction, disrupt, or perform any harmful actions against Valour software, hosting, or hardware
- Attempting to forge the Valour Credit, including creating currencies with the same name or claiming to be the same

## Trading Off-platform

Valour does not explicitly ban the use of the Economic systems for integration with external systems. We strive to support API use and integrations to the best of our ability. However, please note that any transaction that interacts with a third-party system is entirely beyond the purview of Valour Support. Valour does not endorse any associated systems. These connected systems and third-party applications bear full responsibility for their extensions of the Valour Economic and Trading systems and must abide by these rules.

## Account Disablement and Deletion

In the event that a user requests an account deletion or if the account is suspended or terminated by Valour Staff for any reason, all associated virtual currencies and items may be forfeited without any obligation for compensation or reimbursement on the part of Valour. Users are urged to ensure that they fully understand this policy before creating an account or participating in the economic or trading roleplay systems.

## Currency and Item Guidelines

Any virtual currencies or items found to be in violation of the Valour Platform Rules are subject to removal from the platform at Valour's sole discretion. Valour is under no obligation to provide any form of compensation or restitution for the removed currencies or items. By participating in the Valour economic and trading systems, users acknowledge and accept the risk of potential loss due to violation of platform rules.

This also applies to community deletion due to infringement of the Platform Rules, under which the associated currency and items will also be removed from the platform.

## Termination of Services
Valour reserves the right to suspend, discontinue, or terminate any aspect of its services at any time, without prior notice, at its sole discretion. This includes but is not limited to, the Valour economic and trading systems, and any associated APIs.

In the event of such termination, Valour will not be held liable to users or any third party for any consequences resulting from such actions, including but not limited to any loss of virtual currencies, items, or other user-generated content.

By participating in the Valour economic and trading systems, users acknowledge and accept this term and agree not to hold Valour, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or partners liable for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind, as a result of or related to such discontinuation or termination of services.

## Platform Rules

The Valour Economic and Trading systems must be utilized in a manner that adheres to the PLATFORM RULES, which can be accessed at [](https://github.com/Valour-Software/Valour/blob/main/PLATFORM_RULES.md)

Remember, the act of creating an eco account signifies your acceptance of these terms. If you disagree with any part of these terms and conditions, please do not use our services.

This document is subject to change without prior notice, and it is the responsibility of the user to regularly review these terms. Your continued use of the services following any updates or changes to our terms constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
