// A note to those looking:
// The idea of using role combinations and sequential hashing to provide
// an extremely fast and low-storage alternative to traditional RBAC
// is a concept that I have been working on for a while. When I did the
// math and realized just how efficient it could be, I thought about
// monetizing this or patenting it to prevent a company like Discord
// from stealing it. But then I realized that this is a concept that
// should be free and open to everyone. So feel free to use this
// concept in your own projects, and if you want to credit me, that's
// cool too. And also mention Valour :)

// I'm going to also give this system the name HACKR-AUTH
// (HAshed Combined Role Keyed AUTHorization)
// because it sounds cool and I like acronyms.

// There is one slight downside: for a community with 100 roles, there
// is a 1 in 368 quadrillion chance of a hash collision. That's a risk
// I'm willing to take.
